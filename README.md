Flus brings together news feed aggregation and social bookmarking in a modern way.
It is designed as a simple, yet complete tool for organising the links you gather around the Web.

This repository contains the code of the browser extension.
For now, it allows you to easily add any website URL to your bookmarks.

**Note that it only works for the [flus.fr](https://flus.fr) service at the moment.**
If you want to use it with your self-hosted service, youâ€™ll have to change the URL in the file [`configuration.js`](/configuration.js) and package the extension yourself.

For the code of the Web application, see [flusio/Flus](https://github.com/flusio/Flus).
